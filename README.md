# TGV max bot

This nodeJS application will book a TGV max ticket for you. Deployed on a free
heroku dyno and triggered thanks to the free Heroku Scheduler extension.

## Intervals availlable

Thanks to the Scheduler, a free add-on for running jobs on your heroku app at
scheduled time intervals, much like cron in a traditional server environment.
