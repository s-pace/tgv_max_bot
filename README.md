# TGV max bot

This nodeJS application will book a TGV max ticket for you. Deployed on a free
heroku dyno and triggered thanks to the free Heroku Scheduler extension.

## Intervals availlable

Thanks to the
[Heroku Scheduler](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/scheduler), a free
add-on for running jobs on your app at scheduled time intervals, much like cron
in a traditional server environment.
